I have built the chat dashboard as required. The goal was to achieve the requirements while keeping the system scalable and production ready.

To run the project the laptop needs to have node.js installed. Any required package will be installed using npm install and to run the project the command 
is: npm run dev and open local host at port 3000.

I have structured the project as a full stack Next.js application so that frontend and backend api routes are available in the same codebase.
Front end is Next js with React Query for data fetching and caching 
Backend: Next.js Api routes acting as a middleware layer.
for data normalization I have used dedicated normalization utilities 
Styling is through Vanilla 

I have intentionally kept normalization logic away from the API handlers so that front end never touches raw data directly.

Api Endpoints 

GET/api/conversation

This return a normalized list of conversations. Implementation of filtering and sorting is done as required.

All responses follow a consistent success and error envelope as defined in the scope.

GET/api/conversations/:id/messages

This  endpoint returns a full message thread for a specific conversation. Messages are sorted chronologically and normalized. This endpoint also handles cases 
where messages are stored inline or reference separately.

POST /api/conversations/:id/messages

This Allows sending a new message. On success, the relevant conversation and message caches are invalidated. I also implemented optimistic updates on the frontend to improve perceived performance.

PATCH /api/conversations/:id

This Updates fan metadata such as tags. The updated tags are reflected immediately and the cache is invalidated accordingly.

For data normalization:

I implemented a dedicated data normalization layer that would convert:
Field casing to camel casing
timestamps to ISO 8601 UTC
default Nullable fields to safe values
unify inline messages and reference messages into single array 
normalize status values to lower case 
generate avatar fallback when missing

Features implemented

Conversation list with search, filter, and sorting

Scrollable sidebar with unread counts and relative timestamps

Conversation detail view with left and right aligned messages

Message sending with optimistic UI updates

Tag management for fans

Keyboard navigation for improved usability

Responsive layout across screen sizes

In memory caching for API performance

Authentication

I added a mock Bearer token pattern to demonstrate how route protection would work, although it is not enforced by default.

To enable authentication, API handlers can be wrapped with an auth middleware.
